            <p>The <strong>yellow-faced honeyeater</strong> (<em>Caligavis chrysops</em>) is a small to medium-sized
                bird in the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the
                distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty
                minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open sclerophyll
                forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers.
                Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders,
                and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as Banksia and Grevillea, and
                soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.
            </p>
            <p>Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between March
                and May to spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and August to breed in southern
                New South Wales and Victoria. They form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a
                delicate cup-shaped nest. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the
                breeding season.</p>
            <p>Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and
                weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the International
                Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for conservation. It is considered a pest
                in orchards in some areas. </p>

            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and placed in the genus Sylvia, by ornithologist John
                Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae.[2][3] French
                ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English
                zoologist George Robert Gray as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869.[4] The specific name chrysops is derived
                from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo meaning 'face', in reference to the
                stripe of yellow feathers.[5]</p>
            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011.[4]
                Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among
                honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that
                Lichenostomus is not monophyletic.[6] Five species have previously been described as comprising the
                Caligavis subgroup, but studies, using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as
                most closely related to the black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C.
                obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus Caligavis. The generic name
                derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.[7] The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus)
                and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus
                as Bolemoreus.[8] A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found the ancestor of
                the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around
                seven million years ago.[9]</p>
            <p>There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews
                in 1912.[10][11] There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and C. c. samueli
                found in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the
                Atherton Tableland in Queensland. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly
                not worthy of recognition" by the Handbook of the Birds of the World.[12]</p>
            <p>The Surgeon-General of New South Wales John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced
                flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.[13] Latham called
                it the black-cheeked warbler.[2] John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,[14] which has
                become its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference
                to its call.[15] </p>

                        <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name
                            from
                            distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head.[16] Yellow feathers form a narrow
                            stripe
                            above
                            the
                            gape, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on
                            the
                            ear
                            coverts. Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to
                            off-white
                            patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the
                            yellow
                            line.
                            The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey,
                            and
                            the
                            abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green
                            outer
                            edges on
                            the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and
                            slightly
                            down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The iris is a dusky
                            blue
                            in
                            adult
                            birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less
                            streaking
                            on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds
                            are
                            also
                            similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, 0.8 g (0.03 oz) heavier); and in
                            the
                            field
                            there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater
                            averages
                            15–17.5
                            centimetres (5.9–6.9 in) in length, with a wingspan of 21.5–26 cm (8.5–10.2 in), and a
                            weight of
                            12.5–20.5 grams (0.44–0.72 oz), with an average of 17 g (0.60 oz)).[12][15]

                        <p>One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that
                            are
                            full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour,
                            beginning
                            twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.[15] The song is a running series of cheerful notes
                            sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived.[16]
                            Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The
                            territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward
                            inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact
                            calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook
                            or
                            put-put, put-put.[15]</p>

                        Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats—in open sclerophyll
                        forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in riparian woodlands. It
                        most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and
                        stringybarks, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E.
                        melanophloia), with a light, shrubby understorey, and less often in dry, open forests and woodlands
                        dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open
                        forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora)
                        or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and
                        among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (Cytisus
                        scoparius) and blackberries, and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it
                        feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or
                        logging, though it is more common in mature forests.[17] Where it is found in woodland, it is
                        usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.[18]

                        The yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near
                        Cooktown in Far North Queensland, and between a line from Charters Towers south to Albury and the
                        coast, and then west to the Fleurieu Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.
                        Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near Armidale in New
                        South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at Tarnagulla, Victoria. During the winter months of June and
                        July, numbers are generally lower in Victoria and higher in Queensland, following their northward
                        migration.[19]

                        There are resident populations of the yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, but it is for
                        the most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May), it
                        migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland,
                        to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year.[20] The birds commonly move in flocks
                        of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of 1,000 or more. The groups can include other
                        species, such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird, and silvereye.
                        They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour.[21] Over 100,000
                        birds were recorded passing Hastings Point in New South Wales over the course of a single day in May
                        1965.[22] The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields, and uses them to navigate while
                        migrating.[23] Experiments, where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed,
                        indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the
                        field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and
                        the South Pole, rather than north and south.[24] Their flight is in one general direction, but is
                        not in a straight line, as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain
                        ranges, and detour around cities.[25]

                    <p>
                        The migration of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, has generally been described as
                        occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an
                        influx of water.[26] The yellow-faced honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of
                        characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an
                        annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar
                        and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.[27]
