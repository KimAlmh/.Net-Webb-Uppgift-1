            <p>The <strong>yellow-faced honeyeater</strong> (<em>Caligavis chrysops</em>) is a small to medium-sized

                Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides
                of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread
                across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll"

                        <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name
                            from
                            distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head.[16] Yellow feathers form a narrow
                            stripe
                            above
                            the
                            gape, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on
                            the
                            ear
                            coverts. Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to
                            off-white
                            patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the
                            yellow
                            line.
                            The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey,
                            and
                            the
                            abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green
                            outer
                            edges on
                            the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and
                            slightly
                            down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The iris is a dusky
                            blue
                            in
                            adult
                            birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less
                            streaking
                            on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds
                            are
                            also
                            similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, 0.8 g (0.03 oz) heavier); and in
                            the
                            field
                            there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater
                            averages
                            15–17.5
                            centimetres (5.9–6.9 in) in length, with a wingspan of 21.5–26 cm (8.5–10.2 in), and a
                            weight of
                            12.5–20.5 grams (0.44–0.72 oz), with an average of 17 g (0.60 oz)).[12][15]

                        <p>One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that
                            are
                            full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour,
                            beginning
                            twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.[15] The song is a running series of cheerful notes
                            sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived.[16]
                            Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The
                            territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward
                            inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact
                            calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook
                            or
                            put-put, put-put.[15]</p>

                        Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats—in open
                        sclerophyll
                        forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in riparian woodlands. It
                        most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks
                        and
                        stringybarks, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E.
                        melanophloia), with a light, shrubby understorey, and less often in dry, open forests and
                        woodlands
                        dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open
                        forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E.
                        pauciflora)
                        or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and
                        among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (Cytisus
                        scoparius) and blackberries, and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where
                        it
                        feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or
                        logging, though it is more common in mature forests.[17] Where it is found in woodland, it is
                        usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.[18]

                        The yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near
                        Cooktown in Far North Queensland, and between a line from Charters Towers south to Albury and
                        the
                        coast, and then west to the Fleurieu Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.
                        Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near Armidale in
                        New
                        South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at Tarnagulla, Victoria. During the winter months of June
                        and
                        July, numbers are generally lower in Victoria and higher in Queensland, following their
                        northward
                        migration.[19]

                        There are resident populations of the yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, but it is
                        for
                        the most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May), it
                        migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern
                        Queensland,
                        to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year.[20] The birds commonly move in
                        flocks
                        of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of 1,000 or more. The groups can include
                        other
                        species, such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird, and silvereye.
                        They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour.[21] Over
                        100,000
                        birds were recorded passing Hastings Point in New South Wales over the course of a single day in
                        May
                        1965.[22] The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields, and uses them to navigate while
                        migrating.[23] Experiments, where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed,
                        indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of
                        the
                        field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator
                        and
                        the South Pole, rather than north and south.[24] Their flight is in one general direction, but
                        is
                        not in a straight line, as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain
                        ranges, and detour around cities.[25]

                        The migration of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, has generally been described as
                        occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an
                        influx of water.[26] The yellow-faced honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of
                        characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an
                        annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic,
                        solar
                        and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.[27]
