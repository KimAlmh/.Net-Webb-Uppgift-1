                <hr>
                <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
            </span>
            <p>The <strong>yellow-faced honeyeater</strong> (<em>Caligavis chrysops</em>) is a small to medium-sized
                bird in the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the
                distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty
                minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open sclerophyll
                forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers.
                Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders,
                and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as Banksia and Grevillea, and
                soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.
            </p>
            <p>Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between March
                and May to spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and August to breed in southern
                New South Wales and Victoria. They form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a
                delicate cup-shaped nest. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the
                breeding season.</p>
            <p>Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and
                weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the International
                Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for conservation. It is considered a pest
                in orchards in some areas. </p>

            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and placed in the genus Sylvia, by ornithologist John
                Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae.[2][3] French
                ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English
                zoologist George Robert Gray as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869.[4] The specific name chrysops is derived
                from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo meaning 'face', in reference to the
                stripe of yellow feathers.[5]</p>
            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011.[4]
                Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among
                honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that
                Lichenostomus is not monophyletic.[6] Five species have previously been described as comprising the
                Caligavis subgroup, but studies, using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as
                most closely related to the black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C.
                obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus Caligavis. The generic name
                derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.[7] The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus)
                and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus
                as Bolemoreus.[8] A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found the ancestor of
                the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around
                seven million years ago.[9]</p>
            <p>There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews
                in 1912.[10][11] There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and C. c. samueli
                found in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the
                Atherton Tableland in Queensland. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly
                not worthy of recognition" by the Handbook of the Birds of the World.[12]</p>
            <p>The Surgeon-General of New South Wales John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced
                flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.[13] Latham called
                it the black-cheeked warbler.[2] John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,[14] which has
                become its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference
                to its call.[15] </p>

            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name from
                distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head.[16] Yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above the
                gape, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on the ear
                coverts. Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white
                patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line.
                The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the
                abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on
                the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly
                down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The iris is a dusky blue in adult
                birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking
                on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also
                similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, 0.8 g (0.03 oz) heavier); and in the field
                there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages 15–17.5
                centimetres (5.9–6.9 in) in length, with a wingspan of 21.5–26 cm (8.5–10.2 in), and a weight of
                12.5–20.5 grams (0.44–0.72 oz), with an average of 17 g (0.60 oz)).[12][15]</p>
